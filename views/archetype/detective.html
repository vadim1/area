<h3>You are... The Detective!</h3>
<p>
    You value information and are always looking for the facts. You don’t make your decisions based on how you feel—you
    see what the evidence says, and you listen to it. You believe that the more you learn, the better you’ll do—and
    you’re committed to gathering as much information as you can.
</p>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
<p>
    Being the Detective means that you are committed to learning, which means that you tend to have more information and
    be better informed than the people around you. You are focused when you are faced with a decision. You don’t let
    your emotions distract you, and that means you are can thoughtfully look at the evidence around you. You are down to
    earth, and you don’t settle for nonsense. You don’t have a problem making a decision once you feel like you have the
    right information.
</p>
<h4>Blind Spots</h4>
<p>
    Being a Detective comes with a few drawbacks, too. Sometimes, because you are gathering so much evidence, the
    information can blend together and you can lose your ability to be objective. When you face a “confirmation bias,”
    you just use new evidence to confirm what you already thought. Although you are driven by the facts, sometimes when
    you make decisions about the future, you assume that your preferences are going to stay the same forever. This
    “projection bias” makes you interpret the facts based on an outdated idea of success. Finally, because you like to
    soak up lots of information, you sometimes don’t do a good job with time management; this “planning fallacy” means
    that you get so focused on learning that you don’t make your decision on time.
