    <p>
        We make thousands of decisions every day - from when to wake up to
        whether to have a late night snack - and we make them quickly, and
        largely unconsciously. But what happens when we face a high stakes
        decision? Knowing your <strong>PROBLEM SOLVER PROFILE</strong> will
        help you learn about your decision-making strengths and your
        potential blind spots.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>PROBLEM SOLVER PROFILE</strong> is not prospective, it
        tells you what you tend to do when making decisions. By learning
        more about you as a decision maker you can make big decisions better.
