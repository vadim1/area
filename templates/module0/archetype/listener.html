    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>
        In life, there are few things more powerful than having a tight network
        of people who support you. As a Listener, your community is one of your
        biggest assets. You have people who you trust to help you make
        decisions and move forward in your life, and you know that you can
        always turn to them. That is a great position to be in. In general,
        you are a trusting person who believes in the people around you. You
        have no trouble building relationships with people and continuing to
        expand your network of support.
    </p>
    <h4>Blind Spots</h4>
    <p>
        Being a Listener means that you may rely too heavily on other people
        to make decisions for you. Because you are loyal to those you trust,
        you can have a blind spot and make decisions based on what—or who!—
        you like, rather than on what's actually best. This is called the
        "liking bias." In addition because you like to listen to others, hearing
        their stories may lead you to the “narrative bias,” where you overvalue
        storylines and undervalue data. When you pay too much attention to what
        others are thinking and doing, you stop thinking for yourself.
        This "social proof bias" means that you just do what others recommend,
        instead of thinking about what you actually want.

                Why is Mahatma Gandhi a listener?
                Mahatma Gandhi was able to change India through non-violence because of his ability to listen to others
                and
                understand the needs of his people and their arguments. In turn his listening enabled him to be
                persuasive, able to
                reason and negotiate between conflicting parties, whether it was Muslims and Hindus, or between the
                British
                government and its Indian subjects.
