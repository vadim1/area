    The Thinker!
</h3>
<p class="quote">"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler." -Albert Einstein</p>
<p>
    You are a thoughtful decision maker, and you take your time weighing the options before making a decision. You look
    at all the possibilities, and because you are able to see the good and the bad in everything, you like to think on
    it before taking action. You're committed to always making the best possible decision, and you're in no rush to make
    it.
</p>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
<p>
    Being the Thinker means that you will never get caught off guard by the consequences of the decisions you make. You
    are extremely thorough and thoughtful. You are cautious—you know what warning signs to look for, and you are good at
    steering yourself away from them. You're a master at making pro and con lists, and you rarely make impulse
    decisions. This is a powerful thing, because you always know what you're up against. It's hard to trick you, because
    you never act without considering every possible angle.
</p>
<h4>Blind Spots</h4>
<p>
    Being a Thinker can have its negatives, too. Sometimes, because you are so cautious, you pick the safe option so
    that you don't end up failing. This "loss aversion" means that you lose out on the opportunity to fail, and learn
    from your failures, which is proven to help you grow twice as fast as success does. Because you are a master at
    comparing and weighing your options, you sometimes don’t weigh the value of each option individually. For example,
    option 1 may cost less than option 2, but if they are both under your budget, there's no need to eliminate the more
    expensive option. This "relativity bias" keeps you from seeing things as they actually are, and forces you to see
    them in comparison to something else. And finally, because you are committed to thoughtfully looking at what the
    "best" option is, you have the tendency to believe what authority figures say and could fall prey to “authority
    bias.” If someone you admire suggests a decision path, you'll give that choice more weight than you should.

    Why is Albert Einstein a Thinker?
    Most people think that genius is the primary determinant of intellectual achievement. Yet one of the greatest
    thinkers of all time, Albert Einstein was not an inexplicable genius, but a questioning mind. His intellectual
    skills and inquisitive drive enabled him to develop great questions that he then used to search for answers that
    redesigned our view of the physical world and the universe.
