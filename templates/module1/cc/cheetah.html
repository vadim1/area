    <h3>
On the next page youâ€™ll find your first Cheetah Sheet, the guides that ask you questions and provide hints to help your decision hunt.    </h3>
    <h3>
        Why the Cheetah? Cheetahs are agile and flexible hunters. Their speed is not as important as their ability to quickly slow down which makes their hunt agile and flexible, just like a good decision making process should be.
