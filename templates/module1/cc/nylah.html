    <h3>
        Let's take Nylah for example. She's a high school senior living in Brooklyn with her mom, dad and two younger
        sisters. Sheâ€™s deciding whether or not to go away to college. </h3>
    <h3>
        Nylah begins her decision making by starting at the end. She asked herself: &quot;<i>What am I solving for?</i>&quot;
    </h3>
    <h3>
        She answered the question with her Critical Concepts, the three things she needs to have happen for the decision
        to succeed for her personally.
