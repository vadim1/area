    You are a thoughtful decision maker, and you take your time weighing the options before making a decision. You look
    at all the possibilities, and because you are able to see the good and the bad in everything, you like to think on
    it before taking action. You're committed to always making the best possible decision, and you're in no rush to make
    it.

    Why is Albert Einstein a Thinker?
    Most people think that genius is the primary determinant of intellectual achievement. Yet one of the greatest
    thinkers of all time, Albert Einstein was not an inexplicable genius, but a questioning mind. His intellectual
    skills and inquisitive drive enabled him to develop great questions that he then used to search for answers that
    redesigned our view of the physical world and the universe.
